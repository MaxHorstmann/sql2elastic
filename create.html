		<h1>CREATE DATABASE</h1>
		<p>The simplest way to creating a new, empty SQL database is:</p>
		<pre class="sql-code">CREATE DATABASE MyCompany</pre>
		<p>The equivalent Elasticsearch operation is to create a new, empty <em>index</em>:</p>
		<pre class="elastic-code">PUT /MyCompany/</pre>
		
		<h1>CREATE DATABASE (with settings)</h1>
		Often, you'll also pass a bunch of parameters with your CREATE DATABASE statement:	
<pre class="sql-code">	
CREATE DATABASE MyCompany
ON 
( NAME = Empl_dat,
   FILENAME = 'D:\DATA',
   SIZE = 10,
   MAXSIZE = 50,
   FILEGROWTH = 5 )
LOG ON
( NAME = 'Sales_log',
   FILENAME = 'd:\sample log dir\',
   SIZE = 5MB,
   MAXSIZE = 25MB,
   FILEGROWTH = 5MB )
 </pre>  
 <p>Similarly, you can pass a bunch of parameters to Elasticsearch for index creation. Obviously, those
 are very <em>different</em> parameters because, again, Elasticsearch <em>is</em> different. </p>
		<h1>Pro tip: use an alias!</h1>
		<p>One piece of advice: after you've created a SQL database
		<pre class="sql-code">CREATE DATABASE MyCompany</pre>
		you'll typically refer to it by its name throughout your application. You typically don't really expect the name of
		your database to change.</p>
		<p>In Elasticsearch, it's actually a tad more likely that the name of your index is going to change at some 
		point because you might be required to <em>re-index</em> all your documents. For example, it's not possible
		to change the number of <em>primary shards</em> of an index after it has been created.		
		
		<p>Therefore, it's typically a good idea not to reference an index directly by its name throughout your application. 
		Create an <em>alias</em> instead and use it everywhere instead:</p>
		<pre class="elastic-code">
PUT /MyCompany-ActualIndex/

POST /_aliases
{
	"actions": [
		{ "add" : { "index" : "MyCompany-ActualIndex", "alias" : "MyCompany" } }
	]
}
</pre>
		<p>Elasticsearch allows you to atomically <em>swap</em> an alias to another index. That way, for example,
		you can rebuild a new version of your index (which can take some time) while still serving requests from the old version.</p>
